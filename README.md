Welcome to the Final Project for this Specialization on Systems Engineering. We have covered a lot of terrain together. 
To wrap things up, we are going to create an abbreviated Preliminary Design Review (PDR), which will give you an opportunity to practice some of the skills that you have learned over the course of these past weeks and months. 
This is based on an actual Navy system that I helped write a proposal for at Ball Aerospace. 
All of the technical details are made up, but the basis for the system is real. 
You don't need any technical expertise in any of these systems to do this project. 
This is all about exercising the process, not doing real design work. Thank you for all your hard work and dedication throughout the Specialization. I have tried to focus on the practical application of Systems Engineering concepts. I hope you enjoy putting some of them to use for this project and in your professional life.
